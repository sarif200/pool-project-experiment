# Pool-project-experiment

## dependencies
- openCV
- Numpy
- PySimpleGUI
- Dlib

## Known Issues:
- [ ] last image on slideshow is displayed less then 3 seconds
- [ ] when speed is less then 0.7 video stops

## To do:

### User Interface
- [x] Calibration
- [x] Export & import video
- [x] Camera Capture
- [x] Create folder
- [x] Timer
- [x] Image Slideshow

### Program

- [ ] Heatmap

## Coding guides

- mark when going from one cordinate system to an other with 
  -- "#--------transform to ****** space------------"
  
- All time units are measured in ms
- openCV library is written as cv2
- numpy library is written as np
- PySimpleGUI library is written as sg
- all interfaces with SystemDefaultForReal theme
